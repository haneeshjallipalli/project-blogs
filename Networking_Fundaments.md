We’ll walk through the process of what happens **when your laptop sends a request to `https://github.com`**, covering **every micro-detail across all 7 OSI layers**, and incorporate all these real-world networking components.

# 🧠 OSI Model in Real-Life: `https://github.com` Request from a Laptop

---

## 🧭 STEP 0: Initial Trigger

### What Happens:
You type `https://github.com` into your Chrome browser and hit **Enter**.

---

## 🌍 STEP 1: DNS Resolution (Occurs before OSI Layered transmission)

> 🟢 **DNS = Resolving domain name (`github.com`) to IP address**

**Involved protocols:** DNS over UDP (or TCP if necessary)

### Micro-Steps:
1. Chrome checks **local DNS cache** first.
2. If not found:
   - OS asks configured **DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8)**.
   - A **UDP packet (port 53)** is sent to that DNS server with query:  
     `What is the IP of github.com?`
3. DNS server replies (e.g.):  
   `github.com = 3.125.85.112`
4. This IP is now cached by OS/browser for future use.

🔍 This exchange uses the OSI model starting **at Layer 7 down to Layer 1**, just for the DNS query!

---

## 🔐 STEP 2: TLS Handshake (For HTTPS Encryption)

> 🟣 **TLS = Establishing secure encrypted session with the server**

### Micro-Steps:
1. After resolving IP, browser begins **TLS handshake** with the server:
   - **Client Hello** → TLS version, supported ciphers, random number
   - **Server Hello** ← Server's cert, cipher choice, random number
   - Browser verifies **SSL certificate** (via CA chain)
   - Both sides calculate **shared session key** (via Diffie-Hellman or RSA)
2. This handshake happens **before any encrypted HTTP GET** is sent.
3. Entire exchange is encrypted after handshake.

✅ This ensures data is secure via encryption (Layer 6 & 7), over **TCP (Layer 4)**.

---

## 🔁 STEP 3: TCP 3-Way Handshake (Connection Setup)

> 🔵 **TCP = Reliable transport for HTTPS communication**

### Micro-Steps:
1. **SYN** (Client → Server):  
   "Hey server, I want to talk (Seq=1000)"
2. **SYN-ACK** (Server → Client):  
   "Cool, let’s talk (Seq=2000, Ack=1001)"
3. **ACK** (Client → Server):  
   "Great, ready to send data (Ack=2001)"

✅ TCP connection is now **established**. It uses port `443` (for HTTPS).

---

## 🏠 STEP 4: NAT / Firewall Traversal

> 🚧 **Home Router/Firewall must NAT your private IP to public**

### Micro-Steps:
1. Your laptop is on a private IP (e.g., `192.168.0.5`).
2. Router applies **NAT (Network Address Translation)**:
   - Replaces `192.168.0.5` with public IP (e.g., `49.207.100.23`)
   - Tracks port mappings so replies can be forwarded correctly.
3. Firewall checks:
   - Is this connection **allowed out**?
   - Are outgoing ports open? (Usually yes for TCP 443)
4. If allowed, it forwards the packet out to the internet.

# 🌐 FULL OSI LAYER FLOW (NOW WITH ENHANCEMENTS)

Let’s break down the **exact path** from browser to server using the OSI model:

---

### 🔸 **Layer 7 – Application (Chrome Browser)**
- You type: `https://github.com`
- Chrome builds an **HTTP GET** request.
- Data is encrypted with **TLS**.

**Key Data:**
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: github.com
User-Agent: Chrome/...
```

---

### 🔸 **Layer 6 – Presentation**
- Handles **TLS encryption** (SSL).
- Compresses or formats data if needed (e.g., JSON, gzip).
- Ensures outgoing data is **properly encoded**.

---

### 🔸 **Layer 5 – Session**
- Establishes and maintains the **TLS session**.
- Manages **session IDs**, **resumption**, etc.
- Tracks user interaction (e.g., same session for multiple requests).

---

### 🔸 **Layer 4 – Transport (TCP)**
- Splits data into **segments**.
- Adds **source & destination ports**.
- Performs:
  - 3-Way handshake
  - Retransmissions
  - Flow control
  - ACKs

**Example:**
```
Source Port: 49152
Destination Port: 443 (HTTPS)
```

---

### 🔸 **Layer 3 – Network (IP)**
- Adds IP headers with:
  - `Source IP: 192.168.0.5` (your local IP)
  - `Dest IP: 3.125.85.112` (github.com)
- Chooses routing path based on destination IP.

---

### 🔸 **Layer 2 – Data Link (Ethernet/Wi-Fi)**
- Adds **MAC address headers**:
  - Source MAC: your laptop's NIC
  - Dest MAC: your router/gateway
- If unknown, uses **ARP** to find MAC of router.
- Converts packets to **frames**.
- Performs **CRC** error checks.

---

### 🔸 **Layer 1 – Physical**
- Transmits **binary bits** over physical medium:
  - Electrical pulses (Ethernet)
  - Radio waves (Wi-Fi)
- Router or switch receives bits and forwards them.

---

## 🌍 Path to Server (Over Internet)

Your request travels:
- Through your **router/firewall**
- Through **ISP network**
- Across the **Internet backbone**
- Finally reaches **github.com** server

---

## 🧑‍💻 Server Side

The `github.com` server:
1. Accepts the TCP connection
2. Completes the TLS handshake
3. Decrypts and parses HTTP GET
4. Sends back **HTTP 200 OK** with website content

This data is now sent **back through the exact same OSI layers** in **reverse**, and reaches your browser for rendering.

## 📊 Summary (All Combined Together)

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| DNS Resolution | Resolves `github.com` to IP |
| TLS Handshake | Establishes secure session |
| TCP Handshake | Sets up reliable connection |
| NAT/Firewall | Translates IP, checks policy |
| OSI Layers | Transmit encrypted HTTP request |
